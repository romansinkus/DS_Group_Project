    "The 5th highest cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the United States is due in part to strokes (Cerebrovascular Accidents). Strokes are the result of an insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain due to a blood vessel bursting. Subsequently, brain cells die, which can often cause right-sided weakness/paralysis, and sensory impairment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction classification project will answer the question of whether or not someone is likely to experience a stroke based on 8 different core factors relating to health and demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Stroke Prediction Dataset”, acquired from kaggle.com, contains 12 columns, including different factors that may affect someone’s likelihood of experiencing a stroke, as well as whether or not the patient experienced a stroke, and other patient information.\n"
